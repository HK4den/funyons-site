            <h2>Jeffery Epstein Allegedly Risen From the Dead</h2>

            <h3>Written By - John Jonas Jamison</h3>

            <p>Last Friday, images of a zombie-like Jeffery Epstein seem to have surfaced, with the photos supposedly
                being taken near a local Hooters in Las Vegas. Authorities are looking into it, but for the moment
                nobody quite knows if its the real Epstein, or what he's doing at a Hooters in Vegas. For reasons due to
                the amount of blood in the image, we cannot air the photo. Here's a picture of the man at a fancy dinner
                instead (not Hooters).</p>

            <h2>Monkey Mayham in Manhattan Central!?</h2>

            <h3>Written By - Kadence Xeo</h3>

            <p>With the recent band of primates escaping and demanding rights at the St. Louis Zoo, it's unsurprising
                that a
                second gang of them have escaped in manhattan. This group, however, is much less peaceful. In sign
                language
                they seem to be demanding equality for all monkeys or else they'll bring down the Manhattan government.
                If
                they can achieve this is still up for debate, but multiple guns have been taken from officers and it's
                assumed that it was the primates.</p>
